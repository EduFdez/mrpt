<a name="1.2.0">
  <h2>Version 1.2.0: (Under development) </h2></a>
  	- <b>Most important changes:</b>
		- Public header files (.h) have undergone a serious refactoring to minimize unnecesary dependencies and reduce compile time and memory as much as possible.
		  As a side effect, user code might need to add new #include<> lines. This API change justifies the new minor version series 1.2.X.
		- MRPT now cleanly builds in clang and OSX.
		- Support for new camera drivers (OpenNI2, DUO3D).
		- Many bug fixes.
	- <b>Detailed list of changes:</b>
		- Changes in apps:
			- [rawlog-edit](http://www.mrpt.org/Application%3Arawlog-edit):
				- New operations: --export-odometry-txt, --recalc-odometry
				- New flag: --rectify-centers-coincide
		- New examples:
			- kitti_dataset2rawlog
		- New classes:
			- [mrpt-base]
				- mrpt::math::ContainerType<CONTAINER>::element_t to allow handling either Eigen or STL containers seamlessly.
				- mrpt::utils::CConfigFilePrefixer 
			- [mrpt-hwdrivers]
				- mrpt::hwdrivers::COpenNI2Sensor: Interface to OpenNI2 cameras, capable of reading from an array of OpenNI2 RGBD cameras (By Eduardo Fernandez)
				- mrpt::hwdrivers::CDUO3DCamera: Interface to DUO3D cameras (By Francisco Angel Moreno)
				- mrpt::hwdrivers::CGPS_NTRIP: A combination of GPS receiver + NTRIP receiver capable of submitting GGA frames to enable RTCM 3.0 
			- [mrpt-obs]
				- mrpt::slam::CObservation6DFeatures
		- Changes in classes:
			- [mrpt-base]
				- Robust kernel templates moved from mrpt::vision to mrpt::math. See mrpt::math::RobustKernel<>. Added unit tests for robust kernels.
				- CPose3D has new SE(3) methods: mrpt::poses::CPose3D::jacob_dexpeD_de(), mrpt::poses::CPose3D::jacob_dAexpeD_de()
				- More efficient mrpt::utils::OctetVectorToObject() (avoid memory copy).
				- Fixed const-correctness of mrpt::utils::CImage::forceLoad() and mrpt::utils::CImage::unload()
			- [mrpt-hwdrivers]
				- mrpt::hwdrivers::CCameraSensor: Added a hook for user code to run before saving external image files: mrpt::hwdrivers::CCameraSensor::addPreSaveHook()
				- mrpt::hwdrivers::CNationalInstrumentsDAQ now supports analog and digital outputs.
				- New method mrpt::hwdrivers::CNTRIPClient::sendBackToServer()
			- [mrpt-srba]
				- Now also implements SE(3) relative graph-slam.
			- [mrpt-vision]
				- mrpt::vision::checkerBoardStereoCalibration: More robust handling of stereo calibration patterns. OpenCV sometimes detects corners in the wrong order between (left/right) images, so we detect the situation and fix it.
				- mrpt::vision::findMultipleChessboardsCorners():
					- Now enforces a consistent counterclockwise XYZ coordinate frame at each detected chessboard.
					- Much more robust in distingishing quads of different sizes.
		- Build system / public API:
			- Fixes to build in OS X - [Patch](https://gist.github.com/randvoorhies/9283072) by Randolph Voorhies.
			- Removed most "using namespace" from public headers, as good practice.
			- Refactoring of MRPT headers.
				- <mrpt/utils/stl_extensions.h> has been split into:
					- <mrpt/utils/stl_serialization.h>
					- <mrpt/utils/circular_buffer.h>
					- <mrpt/utils/list_searchable.h>
					- <mrpt/utils/bimap.h>
					- <mrpt/utils/map_as_vector.h>
					- <mrpt/utils/traits_map.h>
					- <mrpt/utils/stl_serialization.h>
					- <mrpt/utils/printf_vector.h>
					- <mrpt/utils/stl_containers_utils.h>
					- <mrpt/utils/ci_less.h>
			- Deleted methods and functions:
				- mrpt::system::breakpoint()
				- mrpt::vector_float is now mrpt::math::CVectorFloat, mrpt::vector_double is mrpt::math::CVectorDouble, for name consistency. Also, using Eigen::VectorXf is preferred for new code.
				- mrpt::CImage::rectifyImage() with parameters as separate vectors.
				- mrpt::slam::CPointsMap::getPoint() with mrpt::poses::CPoint3D arguments.
				- mrpt::vision::correctDistortion() -> use CImage method instead
				- All previous deprecated functions.

  		- BUG FIXES:
			- RawlogViewer app: Fixed abort while converting SF->obs.only datasets when there is no odometry.
			- mrpt::slam::CSensoryFrame: The cached point map is now invalidated with any change to the list of observations so it's rebuild upon next call.
			- New implementation of mrpt::synch::CSemaphore avoids crashes in OS X - by Randolph Voorhies.
			- mrpt::opengl::CArrow was always drawn of normalized length.
			- FlyCapture2 monocular & stereo cameras could return an incorrect timestamp (only in Linux?).
			- mrpt::system::createDirectory() returned false (error) when the directory already existed.
			- mrpt::vision::CStereoRectifyMap::rectify() didn't update the left & right camera poses inside mrpt::slam::CObservationStereoImages objects while rectifying.
			- RawLogViewer: Operation "convert to SF format" didn't take into account odometry observations.
			- Fix build errors with GCC 4.9
			- Fix crash of mrpt::hwdrivers::CIMUXSens_MT4's destructor when it fails to scan and open a device.
			- Fix potential crash in mrpt::slam::data_association_full_covariance with JCBB when no individually compatible matching exists [(commit)](https://github.com/jlblancoc/mrpt/commit/482472ebd80a3484dce63d294b1ac4e8f001e1eb)

					- All mrpt::utils::CConfigFileBase::write() now have an extended signature for formatting.

				- mrpt::utils::CConfigFileBase::write() now has signatures for "uint32_t" and "uint64_t" in both 32 and 64bit builds, instead of relying of the "size_t" type. This was done to fix build errors in some GCC versions under 32bits.
				- mrpt::poses::CPose2D now caches the cos() and sin() of phi, with a huge performance improvement in most common operations.
			- [mrpt-bayes]
				- mrpt::bayes::CKalmanFilterCapable (and all EKF-SLAM methods based on it) are now much faster. The implementation now exploits the sparsity of the Jacobian (~25% faster in a test 6D EKF-SLAM dataset) - <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mrpt/source/detail?r=3059" >r3059</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mrpt/source/detail?r=3060" >r3060</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mrpt/source/detail?r=3061" >r3061</a>

			- [mrpt-graphs]
				- mrpt::graphs::CNetworkOfPoses2D, mrpt::graphs::CNetworkOfPoses3D,... and so on, are now all typedef's instead of classes, since serialization is now implemented as pure templatized code, thus avoiding the need to declare derived auxiliary classes  - <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mrpt/source/detail?r=3044" >r3044</a>

				- Repulsive forces from obstacles in mrpt::reactivenav::CHolonomicVFF are now automatically normalized wrt the density of the 360deg view of obstacles and forces follow a "1/range" law instead of the old "exp(-range)".
				- Solved a stability issue in C-S paths, in mrpt::reactivenav::CPTG5 (By Mariano Jaimez Tarifa) - <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mrpt/source/detail?r=3085" >r3085</a>

					- Added a consistency test to avoid seeding RANSAC with an inconsistent initial model.
			- [mrpt-slam]
				- mrpt::slam::CMetricMapBuilderICP now does not integrate the small pose changes due to odometry and/or relocalization when considering the distance and angle thresholds. This means that fewer map updates are now done for the same ICP-SLAM parameters, which should lead to "less noisy" maps.
