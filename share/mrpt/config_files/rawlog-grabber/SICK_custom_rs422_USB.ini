#  Each section [XXXXX] (but [global]) setups a thread in the RawLogGrabber 
#   standalone application. Each thread collects data from some
#   sensor or device, then the main thread groups and orders them before
#   streaming everything to a rawlog file.
#
#  The name of the sections will become the sensor label. The driver for
#   each sensor is actually determined by the field "driver", which must
#   match the name of some class in HWDRIVERS implementing CGenericSensor.
